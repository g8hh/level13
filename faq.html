			<h2>General</h2>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I found a bug! What should I do?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You can report it to the developer. The main platform for reporting bugs is <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a> (go to "Issues" and then click "New Issue"). Alternatively you can leave a comment on the latest bug thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a> or pop by the official <a href="https://discord.gg/BzMbATyKph">Discord server</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I have a suggestion for the game.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You can leave suggestions and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/BzMbATyKph">Discord</a>. Keep in mind that there are plenty of features that are already planned but haven't been implemented yet.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">When will the game be updated?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">This is a personal side project, so development is quite slow and updates are irregular. You can have a look at the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> to see when the game was last updated or check <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a> to see if there's been any recent activity. Be warned that at this stage, updates might break old saves and force you to start over.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Will there be a mobile version?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">The plan is to complete the web version first.</p>
			</div>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="textbox faq-category">
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">How do I advance?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">At first - gather materials, craft a light, make a camp and expand. Later - find blueprints, find stairs and camps, get better gear, make buckets and traps, build your base, repeat. If you have a problem then exploring will usually solve it.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">What is stamina?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Stamina is your energy meter. It's expended by exploring and regenerated by your base camp. Light and equipment can modify costs. You should carefully plan out trips to avoid running out as that causes you to collapse. Once per excursion, you can use food and water to rest for a bit of extra stamina.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I keep running out of food / water / stamina.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Remember to build traps and buckets and use the map to plan out your route. Return to base when you start getting tired and leave any valuables home if you are planning to take a difficult route and risk fainting.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Monsters keep killing me.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Get better gear, or consumables. Remember you don't have to kill all 3 enemies of a gang at once - if you kill one it stays dead. Sometimes, it's just a matter of trying again.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I don't have enough storage space to build anything.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You will be able to expand your storage more later. Explore the map to find out how.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">How do I fix the staircase?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You will need to find the correct blueprints by exploring the map. Some passages will only be fixable later in the game.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">How do I get more crafting ingredients?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">There are spots on the map where specific ingredients are found more often - these are marked with a little icon with four squares. Enemies also often drop ingredients.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Is there anything I can do about raids?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Research fortifications and build up your defences. When a raid is in progress, you can't interact with it.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">There is no camp on level 11!</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Some levels don't have enough human activity or are too polluted to support a camp. There are hints in the log and in the sector description to that effect. The icon at the top of the page (next to the level / camp name) also shows what kind of a level you are on.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Why are some buildings not available / building costs higher / population lower in some camps?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Some levels just don't have enough people living on them to support a full camp and have smaller outposts instead.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Sunlight is blocking me.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">If you don't have protective eyewear you can wait until your eyes adapt.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">How do I get fuel?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You need to find a workshop and clear it of enemies so your workers can use it.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">My dog is gone!</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">You might meet again.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">What is silver used for?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Silver is a currency used for trade and for recruiting followers. Trade and recruiting become available after unlocking the corresponding upgrades. Not all traders accept silver. Later silver can also used for other things.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">What are artefacts for?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Currently, artefacts are not used for anything. Some traders will buy them.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I can't build temples or greenhouses.</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Explore the lowest level to find the Deity. Build shrines, and collect enough Favour to unlock the required technologies. Make sure you've found spots where Greenhouses can be built on earlier levels.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">Is there an ending?</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Yes, the game has a clear ending so you know when you have run out of content.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="collapsible-container">
			<h3 class="collapsible-header">I'm still stuck!</h3>
			<p class="collapsible-content">Head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/BzMbATyKph">Discord</a> and see if you can find some hints or help there.</p>
