            <h2>General</h2>

            <h3>I found a bug! What should I do?</h3>
            <p>You can report it to the developer. The main platform for reporting bugs is <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a> (go to "Issues" and then click "New Issue"). Alternatively you can leave a comment on the latest bug thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a>.</p>

            <h3>I have a suggestion for the game.</h3>
            <p>You can leave suggestions and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a>. Keep in mind that there are plenty of features that are already planned but haven't been implemented yet.</p>

            <h3>When will the game be updated?</h3>
            <p>This is a personal side project, so development is quite slow and updates are irregular. You can have a look at the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> to see when the game was last updated or check <a href="https://github.com/nroutasuo/level13">Github</a> to see if there's been any recent activity. Be warned that at this stage, updates might break old saves and force you to start over.</p>
                        
            <h3>Will there be a mobile version?</h3>
            <p>Not before the web version is complete. Some improvements to the UI to make it work better in mobile browsers are planned though.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>

            <h3>I don't have enough storage space to build anything.</h3>
            <p>You will be able to expand your storage more later. Explore the map to find out how.</p>

            <h3>How do I fix the staircase?</h3>
            <p>You will need to find the correct blueprints by exploring the map. Some staircases will only be fixable later in the game.</p>
            
            <h3>Is there anything I can do about raids?</h3>
            <p>Research fortifications and build up your defences. When a raid is happening, you can't interact with it.</p>
                        
            <h3>There is no camp on level 11!</h3>
            <p>Some levels don't have enough human activity or are too polluted to support a camp. There are hints in the log and in the sector description to that effect. Find the next passage and move on.</p>

            <h3>How do I get fuel?</h3>
            <p>You need to find a workshop and clear it of enemies so your workers can use it.</p>

            <h3>How do I get more crafting ingredients?</h3>
            <p>Enemies often drop them. Find some fights on the map.</p>

            <h3>What is silver used for?</h3>
            <p>Silver is a currency used for trade. Trade will become available after unlocking the corresponding upgrade. Not all traders accept silver.</p>

            <h3>What are artefacts for?</h3>
            <p>Currently, artefacts are not used for anything.</p>

            <h3>Is there an ending?</h3>
            <p>The game will let you know when you've reached the end of the currently available content.</p>

            <h3>I'm still stuck!</h3>
            <p>Head over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/level13">Reddit</a> and see if you can find some hints there.</p>
